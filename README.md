# Dotify (HW3)
Author: Coco Li

This is a simple music player that allows user to see and shuffle a playlist of songs. The user can also click on the miniplayer to be navigated to the song player page where the song's album picture, title, and artist's name will be displayed. Rotate the phone on the song player page will show a different layout with the same components. On the Settings page, the user can navigater to Profile, About, and Statistics page repectively.

**Extra Credit:**

1. Every Fragment (other than SettingsFragment) has a Up/back button in the top left corner. Clicking will take you back to the previous fragment (+.25)

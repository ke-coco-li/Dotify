# Dotify (HW4)
Author: Coco Li

This is a simple music player that allows user to see and shuffle a playlist of songs. The user can also click on the miniplayer to be navigated to the song player page where the song's album picture, title, and artist's name will be displayed. Rotate the phone on the song player page will show a different layout with the same components. On the Settings page, the user can navigater to Profile, About, and Statistics page repectively. For HW4, I used an HTTP request to get the user information and used Coil to load the user profile picture with a url. Also, if the HTTP request fails, it will display an error message.

**Extra Credit:**

1. Add pull down to refresh function to your activity to trigger an HTTP fetch (+.25)

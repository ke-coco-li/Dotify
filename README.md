# Dotify (HW5)
Author: Coco Li

This is a simple music player that allows user to see and shuffle a playlist of songs. The user can also click on the miniplayer to be navigated to the song player page where the song's album picture, title, and artist's name will be displayed. Rotate the phone on the song player page will show a different layout with the same components. On the Settings page, the user can navigater to Profile, About, and Statistics page repectively. For HW5, it now pushes notification about newly released songs to users.

**Extra Credit:**

1. FOR DOTIFY project ONLY: In requirement 2.b.v.2, tapping the notification should launch PlayerActivity that passes the song data to the activity to show the song in the player (+1)
